About Python
============

Python is a remarkably powerful dynamic programming language that is used in a
wide variety of `application domains </about/apps>`__. Python is often
compared to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme or Java. Some of its key distinguishing
features include:

* very clear, readable syntax
* strong introspection capabilities
* intuitive object orientation
* natural expression of procedural code
* full modularity, supporting hierarchical packages
* exception-based error handling
* very high level dynamic data types
* extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually every task
* extensions and modules easily written in C, C++ (or Java for Jython, or .NET languages for IronPython)
* embeddable within applications as a scripting interface

Python is powerful... and fast
------------------------------

Fans of Python use the phrase "batteries included" to describe the
`standard library <http://docs.python.org/3/library/>`_, which covers
everything from asynchronous processing to zip files. The language itself
is a flexible powerhouse that can handle practically any 
`problem domain </about/apps>`__.
Build your own web server in three lines of code. Build flexible
data-driven code using Python's powerful and dynamic introspection
capabilities and advanced language features such as `meta-classes
<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html>`_,
`duck typing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing>`_ and
`decorators </dev/peps/pep-0318/>`_. 

Python lets you write the code you need, quickly. And, thanks to a highly
optimized byte compiler and support libraries, Python code runs more than 
fast enough for most applications. The traditional implementation of CPython
uses a bytecode virtual machine; `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
supports just-in-time (JIT) compilation to machine code. Also, Jython and 
IronPython (see below) support JIT compilation on their respective 
virtual machine implementations.

Python plays well with others
-----------------------------

Python can integrate with `COM <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_, `.NET
<http://www.zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet>`_, and `CORBA
<http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/81254>`_ objects.  

For Java libraries, use `Jython <http://www.jython.org>`_, an
implementation of Python for the Java Virtual Machine.   

For .NET, try `IronPython <http://www.ironpython.net/>`_ ,
Microsoft's new implementation of Python for .NET, or `Python for .NET 
<http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Python is also supported for the `Internet Communications Engine (ICE) 
<http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html>`_ and many other integration technologies.

If you find something that Python cannot do, or if you need the
performance advantage of low-level code, you can write `extension
modules <http://docs.python.org/3/extending/>`_ in C or C++, or
wrap existing code with `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_ or 
`Boost.Python <http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/>`_. Wrapped modules
appear to your program exactly like native Python code. That's
language integration made easy. You can also go the opposite route and
`embed Python <http://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html>`_ in your
own application, providing your users with a language they'll enjoy
using. 

Python runs everywhere
----------------------

Python is available for all major operating systems: Windows,
Linux/Unix, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, among others. There are even
versions that run on `.NET <http://ironpython.net/>`__ and 
the `Java virtual machine <http://www.jython.org/>`_. You'll be pleased to
know that the same source code will run unchanged across all
implementations.

Your favorite system isn't listed here? It may still support Python if 
there's a C compiler for it. Ask around on `news:comp.lang.python
<news:comp.lang.python>`__ - or just try compiling Python yourself.

Python is friendly... and easy to learn
---------------------------------------

The Python newsgroup is known as one of the friendliest around. The avid
developer and user `community </community>`_ maintains a 
`wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/>`_, hosts international and local 
`conferences </community/workshops>`_, runs development sprints, 
and contributes to online code repositories.

Python also comes with complete `documentation </doc>`_, both integrated into
the language and as separate web pages. Online tutorials target both the
`seasoned programmer
<http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers>`_ and the
`newcomer <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers>`_.
All are designed to make you productive quickly. The availability of
first-rate `books <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks>`_ completes
the learning package.

Python is Open
--------------

The Python implementation is under an open source license that
makes it **freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use**.
The `Python license </psf/license/>`__ is administered by the `Python Software Foundation </psf/>`__.

Take a look at `application domains </about/apps>`__ where Python is used, or
try the `current download </download/>`__ for yourself.
