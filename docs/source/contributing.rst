Before submitting a PR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Run the test suite and make sure it passes:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make test

2. Run the linter and formatter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make lint
      make fmt

3. If you changed models, check for missing migrations:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make migrations

4. Write tests for any new or changed code.

5. Keep pull requests focused — one issue or feature per PR is easier to
   review than a large PR that touches many parts of the system.

6. Include a clear description of what your PR does and why.

CI checks
~~~~~~~~~

GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request. It will:

- Check for ungenerated migrations (``makemigrations --check --dry-run``)
- Run the full test suite
- Enforce a **75% minimum test coverage** threshold

PRs that fail CI won't be merged.

Code style
~~~~~~~~~~

- Follow :pep:`8`
- Use ``make lint`` (ruff) to catch issues and ``make fmt`` (ruff) to
  auto-format
