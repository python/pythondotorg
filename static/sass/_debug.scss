		detailed here: http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/utilities/color/contrast/
		Used to pass two colors into a get out the most readable color. 
		Good for situations where we dont want to create a new color, 
		but be sure that colors from variables are always going to be readable

 * Or, in this case, we did it by hand by comparing Flux to Arial, side by side. 
 * We then adjusted it further visually, as Flux is more condensed and therefore line-length changes pretty dramatically.

	Compass will convert the font sizes from px to em and fit it into the vertical rhythm automatically with the necessary margin 
	A neat trick, for sure. More on using the vertical rhythm properties and mixins: http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/
	
	Note: The line height is relative to the constant $base-line-height. 
	The number you specify for the leader, trailer and leading will be multiplied by the constant, then converted to its relative value in ems. 
	Donâ€™t worry about nested elements etc, Compass will do the maths for you :)
