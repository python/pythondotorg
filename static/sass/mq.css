! Because "touch" is present, we assume that the browser can handle cssTransform3d and cssTransition, which might be dangerous
! If there is no javascript running, than the .jump-to-menu link will jump to #site-map (footer) and the .main-navigatin will remain offscreen, which is not such a bad fallback.
