        I'd like some feedback to appear at the top of the page if the form reloads and there is info missing.
        If the error is at the bottom of the page, no one will see it and realize there is something wrong.
    
        If the form is submitted successfully, we should let the user know as well.
    
        Samples below:
    {% endcomment %}
    
    {% if form.errors %}
    <div class="user-feedback level-error">
        <p role="alert"><span class="icon-alert" aria-hidden="true"><span class="larger">&#9888; </span></span>Please correct the errors <b>noted in red</b> below:</p>
    </div>

                <p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers &mdash; other Python users. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.</p>
    
                <h3>Respectful</h3>
                <p>Members of the community are respectful. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
