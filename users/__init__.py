Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but 
effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s 
elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted 
nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application 
development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types 
implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also 
suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
